# NixOS for Apt/Yum Users: a Gift That Keeps on Giving

Originally published at [drakerossman.com](https://drakerossman.com/blog/nixos-for-apt-yum-users-a-gift-that-keeps-on-giving).

This folder contains `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix` which are then to be found under `/etc/nixos` on your freshly installed NixOS system. Note, that your autogenerated `hardware-configuration.nix` may differ from the one in this folder, so you should better be using the one you've got already.

You can also find the overview of shell scripts used for the installation inside `installation-scripts.sh`, which are not meant to be copy-pasted, but to be read carefully and adjusted to your configuration.
